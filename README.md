## Introduction
This project utilizes RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology to read and process data from RFID tags. It then sends requests to the Spotify API to control my music playback, essentially making it a modern day jukebox/vinyl player .

## Hardware Requirements
- RFID Reader (RC522)
- RFID Tags
- Microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Model 4)
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

## Acknowledgments
- Inspiration from various open-source RFID projects
